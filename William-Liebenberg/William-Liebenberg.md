## Application Modernization

Specializing in [Application Modernization](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Strategic-Architecture.aspx) he helped some of Australia's largest software companies and financial institutions through the digital transformation processes and sucessfully [migrate to Azure](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Azure.aspx) and take full advantage of the Cloud.

## Development Technologies

He is one of the core engineers at SSW and specializes in developing Enterprise Cloud Applications with [Azure](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Azure.aspx).

William has a passion for developing enterprise-grade [Web Applications](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Web-Applications.aspx), and automating Build, Release and Testing with Azure DevOps Pipelines. William also has experience in using VSTS/TFS, TeamCity, Jenkins, and Bamboo.

## Internal Projects

### [SSW Sophie Bot](https://sswsophie.com/sophiebot)

William lead a team to build a smart office bot that integrates with Microsoft Teams, Skype and Google Assistant.

One major use case for **SophieBot** is to help our SSW State Managers and Clients to find the right Developer for any project simply by talking to a Bot with natural human language. SophieBot can determine which developers in any of our offices have the right skills for a project and even if they are available to be booked for this project. All the information required to answer this simple query can be spread across multiple systems such as Dynamics CRM, TimePro, LinkedIn, SalesForce, Delve, and more. SophieBot has integrations that can collect all the relevant information and fulfill the seemingly simple query:

> "Who has Angular skills available next week for 4 days?"
